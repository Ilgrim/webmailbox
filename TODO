- how to fetch and show latest mails when user visit?

only fetch message headers when user visit,
and then send to message que for fetch whole message?

or just store mails headers?

maybe we can add an cyclic AJAX in every page
to create message for fetching mails.

- how to show multipart message better?

- how to get new connection after database interruption and reconnection?

building connections pool?

(MongoDB, Redis, ...)

- to prevent overly fetching, need to enhance message queue

save the last fetched message,
and check time interval between fetching message and fetched message.
if time interval < FETCH_TIME_INTERVAL, than pass.
